               <p class="ptag1">My name is Franklin Sattern, and I'm go to Bartlett High School. I like to hang out with friends and just chill with them. I'm trying to do some rap stuff with them. That's one of my goals in life to come up and be living that rapper life. Most people think it would never happen, but they just haters. Stuff like this blowing up at the momment. I feel like this is the perfect time to do it. I listen to a lot of rap, I like to listen to those underground rappers. The ones that actually think that have a chance to come up. I also like to just spend bands, just spend money that how life should be, get money and just enjoy it. I aLso taking a Web design class. Sorry Mrs. Senclair that i turned it late, I actually wanted to challenge myself and learn it. I feel this is a good step.</p>
